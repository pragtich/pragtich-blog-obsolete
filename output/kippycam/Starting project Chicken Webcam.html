             I am starting a new project: a solar-powered webcam in the chicken coop….</summary><bodytext><p>I have started a new project: I want to make a webcam in the chicken coop. The poor chickens are out there all day, out of sight of the house. And when we’re away, it would be good to be able to check on them now and then, and make sure that they’re not getting up to any mischief. Wouldn’t it be cool to be able to snap pictures when they’re up to no good (like eating that mouse they found, or jumping over the fence, again….)? And it would be a great step towards all kinds of cool automation projects, starting with automatic door closing at night.</p>

<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>

<ul>
<li>To be self-powered: no running power lines through the garden</li>
  <li>Wireless connection to the house: no running ethernet cables either</li>
  <li>At least one webcam, preferably HDTV quality, preferably extension to 3 cameras to be possible in the future</li>
  <li>Reasonably self-managing and low-maintenance</li>
  <li>Low cost: we’re getting married this year</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h1>

<p>The main idea for this project came from “<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-set-up-a-solar-powered-webcam-server-using-/">How to set up a solar powered webcam server using NanosG20 running Debian</a>” by Janisalnis on instructables. </p>

<p><img src="janisalnis.jpg" alt="Picture of Janisalnis' setup" title="This is how his project looked when he wrote about it"></p>

<p>Building from this idea, janisalnis already makes the recommendation that modern routers are <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-set-up-home-data-server-using-OpenWRT-on-Li/">a much smarter way to go</a>. And on <a href="http://barbara320.gotdns.com/">his homepage</a> there are many examples of the results of his great projects. There, he links <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JanisAlnis/home-automation-12979616">a presentation that really drew my attention</a>. He is a really creative guy!</p>

<p>On one slide, he refers to the TP-LINK WR703N, a small router with less than 1W power consumption, yet quite a powerful CPU and USB 2.0! He already refers to a list of possibilities, like HD webcams, USB audio and Arduino linking. Cool stuff! Shockingly enough, these powerful machines sell on ebay for less than EUR20 !!</p>

<p>And I have played with OpenWRT before, so this is starting to look like a great thing. The first two TL-WR703N’s have been ordered, cannot wait for them to get here from Hong Kong!</p>

<p><em>UPDATE</em>: I later learned that there is a slightly larger, but largely similar router that can be bought in Europe for a bit more money (but without the long wait): the TL-MR3020. I already had my orders for the smaller one in, but maybe it can be an option for later.</p>

<h2 id="wireless-connection">Wireless connection</h2>

<p>The chicken coop is located in the garden behind my house. This could be ~50 meters from the current location of the main wireless router. Also, the signal needs to pass through several brick walls. All in all, there is no chance that we will have a connection using any simple method. Indeed, even my MacBook (which has a great antenna) does not get a connection in most of the garden. </p>

<p>So how to get this to work? I will probably add a cantenna to the WR703 in the garden to get good reception and either move the main wireless router to a better location (the attic?) or set up a repeater somewhere in the house, possibly also with a cantenna. This will take some experimentation.</p>

<h2 id="solar-powering">Solar powering</h2>

<p>For the start of the project, I will go with direct solar powering from the panels. No storage. Once the principle has been proven, I will be charging a battery. I did some research on Open Source solar charge controller projects with the idea of making my own charger. While there are some very nice designs around, I really prefer to go with a proven technology. I want the development of the camera to be the fun part, not the screwing with a battery charger. Ultimate efficiency is also not a parameter for me, so I will probably go with either one of these 2 options:</p>

<p>And realistically, at around EUR 20 a piece, there is not a lot to lose.</p>

<p>Solar panel prices have dropped a lot recently. The cheap made-in-China panels are dropping close to the EUR 1 per Watt-peak mark at the moment. Of course, I have learned from reading, that the cheap suppliers can be quite optimistic regarding their specified Watt-peak values. So in fact the more expensive panels from ‘real’ manufacturers are supposed to be worth the extra cash. For me, a factor was the availability of reasonably priced small panels on the <a href="http://www.ebay.de">Ebay</a> was good. I purchased 2x 30W panels from <a href="http://myworld.ebay.de/enjoysolarshop/">Enjoy Solar in Bremen</a>, and will see how they perform. <strong>NOTE:</strong> There seem to be many sellers on ebay that do get very good reviews, but also rack up significant negative comments. Be sure to check the negative comments for a seller before you buy. I nearly fell for a promising-looking seller, which clearly does not take after-sales care as seriously as any (German!) seller should…</p>
