# Some things that I still intend to do with this site #

* ADD A picture of my configuration screens in `luci` to the layout
  page.
* Add a description page of installing mjpg-streamer (especially
  editing the startup script) and link in the network-layout page
* Add photo of line of sight to network-layout
* Get a proper domain hosting instead of [my old athome.nl site](http://members.home.nl/pragtich)
* Add "title" stuff so that a Markdown image gets a caption
* Clean up the design 
* Make a new design with moe modern and cleaner look
* Devise a more structured way of working with images, flowing them in the text etc.
* Make a design that actually numbers <ol> and not <ul>
* Make sure that titles in the title list also get passed through rubypants
* Research [Railroad](http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-graphviz-data-visualization-1477.html)
